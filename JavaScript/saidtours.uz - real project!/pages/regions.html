        the Timurids and the Khanates, all of them have been instrumental in
        reshaping and rediscovering the course of Uzbekistan history. The
        Sogdiana, Bactria and Khwarezm were the first civilizations, who
        occupied the territories of Ferghana, Tashkent, Bukhara, Khorezm and
        Samarkand regions of Uzbekistan. Alexander the Great conquered Sogdiana
        and Bactria in 327 BC. The medieval history of Uzbekistan, witnessed the
        conquest by the Muslim Arabs in the 8th century AD. The Persian Samanid
        dynasty established its stronghold in the area. In the year 1220,
        Uzbekistan and the rest of Central Asia was invaded by the fierce and
        aggressive Genghis Khan and his Mongol tribes. In the 1300s, the Timur's
        overthrew the Mongols and occupied Uzbekistan. Later on, separate Muslim
        states emerged, with strong ties with the neighboring Persia. During
        this time, the development of Uzbekistan gained a rapid pace. Fabulous
        mosques and madrassahs were built. Uzbekistan literature reached its
        zenith of glory with the emergence of well known literary figures in
        this period. The main turning point of history of Uzbekistan is the
        Russian occupation in the year 1865. It led to the establishment of the
        Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. During the Soviet era Uzbekistan became
        a world famous cotton growing region of the world. Finally, on August
        31, 1991, Uzbekistan declared its independence from the Soviet Union and
        Islam Karimov was elected the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan.

            Bukhara, Uzbek Bukhoro or Buxoro, also spelled Buchara or Bokhara,
            city, south-central Uzbekistan, located about 140 miles (225 km)
            west of Samarkand. The city lies on the Shakhrud Canal in the delta
            of the Zeravshan River, at the centre of Bukhara oasis. Founded not
            later than the 1st century CE (and possibly as early as the 3rd or
            4th century BCE), Bukhara was already a major trade and crafts
            centre along the famous Silk Road when it was captured by Arab
            forces in 709. It was the capital of the Sāmānid dynasty in the 9th
            and 10th centuries. Later it was seized by the Qarakhanids and
            Karakitais before falling to Genghis Khan in 1220 and to Timur
            (Tamerlane) in 1370. In 1506 Bukhara was conquered by the Uzbek
            Shaybānids, who from the mid-16th century made it the capital of
            their state, which became known as the khanate of Bukhara.

            Kesh. It was the famous center of culture, trade and handicrafts. In

            culture and cult of the Greek gods appeared there. Over millennium
            Shakhrisabz was under the reign of various dynasties and in the 8th
            century it was the center of anti-Arab and anti-Islam rebellion.

            Samarkand, Uzbek Samarqand, city in east-central Uzbekistan that is
            one of the oldest cities of Central Asia. Known as Maracanda in the
            4th century BCE, it was the capital of Sogdiana and was captured by
            Alexander the Great in 329 BCE. The city was later ruled by Central
            Asian Turks (6th century CE), the Arabs (8th century), the Samanids
            of Iran (9th–10th century), and various Turkic peoples (11th–13th
            century) before it was annexed by the Khwārezm-Shāh dynasty (early
            13th century) and destroyed by the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan
            (1220). After it revolted against its Mongol rulers (1365),
            Samarkand became the capital of the empire of Timur (Tamerlane), who
            made the city the most important economic and cultural centre in
            Central Asia. Samarkand was conquered by Uzbeks in 1500 and became
            part of the khanate of Bukhara. By the 18th century it had declined,
            and from the 1720s to the 1770s it was uninhabited. Only after it
            became a provincial capital of the Russian Empire (1887) and a
            railroad centre did it recover economically. It was briefly
            (1924–36) the capital of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic.
            Samarkand today consists of an old city dating from medieval times
            and a new section built after the Russian conquest of the area in
            the 19th century.
